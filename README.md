# Class Roster Program

To use this program, you need a .csv with headers.

The headers should have the following names and be in the following order:

*First Name

*Last Name

*netid

*email

*linkedin

*group

netid = the unique identifier for the student given by uiuc (the part of their email before @illinois.edu)

linkedin = the URL of their linkedin

group = the name of their group (without the word "group", this will be added by the program)

## Use of the program

The program will launch a dialog box that prompts you to select your .csv. It also prints some instructions for ease of use.

It will create a text file containing the html code (this is for ease of copying to blackboard) with the class roster, in the file where the python program is stored.

When you have the text file, move the /p tag at the top to the bottom of the .txt file
