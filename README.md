# Class Roster Program

To use this program, you need a .csv with headers.

The headers should have the following names and be in the following order:
*First Name
*Last Name
*netid
*email
*linkedin
*group

netid = the unique identifier for the student given by uiuc (the part of their email before @illinois.edu)
linkedin = the URL of their linkedin
group = the name of their group (without the word "group", this will be added by the program)

## Use of the program

The program will launch a dialog box that prompts you to select your .csv. It also prints some instructions for ease of use.

It will create a text file containing the html code (this is for ease of copying to blackboard) with the class roster, in the file where the python program is stored.
